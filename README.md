A rather hastily cobbled together Minecraft 1.10.2 Forge mod to connect
a Minecraft Forge server with a Discord server.

It's really not finished at all, probably won't be finished for a long time.
However, it's undergoing continuous testing and improvement. Infrequent updates,
frequent bugs, probably won't be posted anywhere any time soon.
Feel free to compile this and use it if you want it.

Installation:
drop the mod in the mods folder on the server and launch the server. close the server,
then open the config folder and find the chatotchatbot.cfg file, and set everything
accordingly. You may have to enable developer mode in Discord to get the Server ID and
your UUID and the Channel ID.
There's a bunch of other stuff in the config as well, it should be explained in the
comments.

uhhh... that's basically it. Don't install it client side, I have no idea what it'll
do.
